# GonziBot
This project is a multi-purpose Discord bot made for entertainment. The features we decided to add to the bot were things we thought would make Discord nights a little bit more fun!

## Bot Features: 
- Earn gold and points by playing minigames.
- A SQLite database to save data, integrated directly into Python!
- Pull posts from social media, including Twitter and Reddit.
- Send messages of randomly chosen film quotes.
- Send welcome messages to new users.
- Send funny gifs using the command.
- Display a leaderboard of all players.
- Delete user posts using emojis.
And more!

## Commands:
- !rpg
- !rps
- !battle
- !numberguess
- !tweet \<twitter handle\>
- !reddit \<subreddit\>
- !gif \<topic\>
- !serverstats
- !stats \<@user\>
- !ping
- !kick
- !ban
- !quote

In the future, we intend to expand upon these commands, add more minigames, and create a rewards shop that users can spend their minigame points and gold on. These rewards can include custom emotes or server roles.
